The main difference between a list and a tuple in Python is:


List is Mutable (can be changed) while Tuple is‚ùå Immutable (cannot be changed).
Syntax of List is	[] (e.g., [1, 2, 3]) while the Syntax of Tuple is	() (e.g., (1, 2, 3))
Performance of a List is	Slower (because it's mutable)	while the performance of a Tuple is Faster (because it's immutable)
Use Case of a List is	When data can change while the Use Case of a Tuple is	When data should stay constant

So in short:
Use list when you need to modify the data.
Use tuple when the data should be fixed and protected.
